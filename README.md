# Convolution-Operation

This repository contains a notebook (in .ipynb form as well as .html for ease of reading) which gives an extensive walkthrough of methods of analysis one can use the convolution operator for when dealing with data distributed in a variety of ways (continuous and discrete). Further, it delves into how to calculate a sigma threshold, and describes the importance of doing so. Finally, it explains the effect of the trials factor on the sigma threshold.
